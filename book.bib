The stationarity conditions and autocorrelation structure of the Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) model are derived. Using an empirical example of uncertainty of the inflation rate the paper demonstrates that the GARCH model provides a better fit and a more plausible learning mechanism than the ARCH model.},

Using the modified GARCH-M model, they also show that monthly conditional volatility may not be as persistent as was thought. Positive unanticipated returns appear to result in a downward revision of the conditional volatility, whereas negative unanticipated returns result in an upward revision of conditional volatility.

The series is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend, random walk, and stationary error, and the test is the LM test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary. Finite sample size and power are considered in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected.}

  abstract = {Abstract The rapid development of modeling techniques has brought many opportunities for data-driven discovery and prediction. However, this also leads to the challenge of selecting the most appropriate model for any particular data task. Information criteria, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), have been developed as a general class of model selection methods with profound connections with foundational thoughts in statistics and information theory. Many perspectives and theoretical justifications have been developed to understand when and how to use information criteria, which often depend on particular data circumstances. This review article will revisit information criteria by summarizing their key concepts, evaluation metrics, fundamental properties, interconnections, recent advancements, and common misconceptions to enrich the understanding of model selection in general.
